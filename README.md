# Caesar Cipher Cryptography 🔐

This is a simple Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher — a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `cesar_cipher.py` — Core logic to encrypt and decrypt messages using Caesar Cipher.
- `main.py` — Main program interface for user input and output.
- `tests/` — (Optional) Unit tests for encryption/decryption functions.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ReneMonreal/Cesar_Cipher_Cryptography.git
   cd Cesar_Cipher_Cryptography
